Here I have Car leasing calculator. We can choose Car type and with that interestRate changes.

Lease period is select box where I can choose lease period from 12 to 60 months. Also there are inputs and range inputs for Car value and down payment.

The validation of these input is done in way, for example, when you type car value below 10.000, and the input loses focus, the car value is returned to min value. That is done also for max value if you type something above 200000.

When you type good value for car, the range input automatically goes to that value.

When you change some values, the placeholders below automatically calculates their value.

All calculation is done in function updatePrice.

The responsive design is done in way that when you go below 650px, the interface changes so it fits to mobile devices and it is adaptable to all screens.
